# ML Mini Platform üöÄ

## üìñ Description of the Solution

The **ML Mini Platform** is my lightweight, containerized experimental solution designed to streamline the entire lifecycle of machine learning models. With this platform, I aim to:

- **Catalog Datasets** üìÇ: Easily upload and normalize dataset files while storing important metadata in a database.
- **Train Models** ü§ñ: Automatically train ML models using cataloged datasets, save model artifacts in object storage (MinIO or S3), and register them with versioning.
- **Promote Models** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è: Seamlessly promote models between environments‚Äî**dev**, **staging**, and **production**‚Äîby creating new artifacts and updating the registry. *Note: A model can only be promoted (from dev to staging or production); demotion is not allowed.*
- **Serve Predictions** üîÆ: Provide a dedicated endpoint to serve predictions using the latest model for a given dataset and environment.
- **Interactive API Documentation** üìú: Explore and test all endpoints through automatically generated Swagger UI.

This platform is an experimental project aimed at demonstrating a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow in a containerized environment.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dataset Cataloging**  
  üìÇ Upload datasets via an API. The system automatically normalizes file names (e.g., converting `"My DataSet.csv"` to `"my_dataset"`), stores metadata in the database, and saves files in object storage.

- **Automated Model Training & Registration**  
  ü§ñ Train models using your cataloged datasets. The platform saves model artifacts with a consistent naming convention (including dataset, environment, and version) and registers them in a SQLite (or configurable) database.

- **Model Promotion**  
  ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Promote models between environments. The platform supports three environments:
  - **dev**: The initial environment where models are trained.
  - **staging**: An intermediate environment for further validation.
  - **production**: The final environment for serving predictions.
  
  Models can only be promoted (e.g., from dev to staging or production); demotion is not permitted.

- **Prediction Serving**  
  üîÆ Retrieve predictions by specifying the dataset and environment. The system automatically loads the latest model version to serve predictions.

- **Interactive Documentation**  
  üìú Access the Swagger UI for interactive API exploration and testing.

- **Containerization**  
  üê≥ Uses Docker & Docker Compose for rapid, consistent deployment and scaling.

## üöÄ How to Run (Using Docker Compose)

1. **Prerequisites:**  
   - Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)  
   - Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

2. **Build & Run:**  
   In your project directory, run:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
   This command will:
   - Build the application container.
   - Start the MinIO service with persistent storage.
   - Run an initialization container that creates the `datasets` and `trained-models` buckets.
   - Start the FastAPI application container.

3. **Database Initialization:**  
   The SQLite database (`ml_registry.db`) is stored in the mounted volume `/app/data` and is automatically created (if not existing) when the app starts.

## üåê How to Access and Use

### Swagger UI Documentation

Once the platform is running, open your browser and navigate to:  
[http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)  
The Swagger UI provides interactive API documentation with detailed request and response models (e.g., `DatasetResponse`, `TrainResponse`, `PredictResponse`) that include example payloads.

---

## üìö Test Solution Guide

The following steps outline an end-to-end workflow for testing the ML Mini Platform.

### 1. Upload a Sample Dataset

1. In the Swagger UI, navigate to the **Dataset** section.
2. Select the `POST /datasets/upload` endpoint.
3. Upload the sample file **Iris.csv** from the `samples` folder.  
   *(You can leave the default dataset name as `iris_dataset` or change it.)*
4. Click **Execute**.
5. Verify that the response includes details such as dataset ID, name, location, and creation timestamp.

---

### 2. Train a New Model

1. In Swagger, navigate to the **Models** section.
2. Select the `POST /train` endpoint.
3. Fill in the parameters:
   - **dataset_name**: Use the name of your uploaded dataset (e.g., `my_dataset`).
   - **target_column**: For example, `Species`.
   - **model**: Provide a sample configuration, for instance:
     ```json
     {
       "model_class": "RandomForestClassifier",
       "model_params": {
         "n_estimators": 100,
         "max_depth": 5
       }
     }
     ```
   - Optionally, adjust `test_size` and `random_state`.
4. Click **Execute**.
5. Confirm that the response (modeled by `TrainResponse`) includes details like the model file name, environment (default is `dev`), version, target column, features, and training metrics.

---

### 3. Promote the Model to Production

Our solution supports three environments: **dev**, **staging**, and **production**.  
- **dev**: The environment where models are initially trained.  
- **staging**: An intermediate environment for further validation.  
- **production**: The final environment used for serving predictions.

When you train a model, it is created in the **dev** environment. You can then promote the model to a higher environment (staging or production) using the `/promote` endpoint.  
*Remember: Once promoted, models cannot be demoted to a lower environment.*

1. In Swagger, select the `POST /promote` endpoint.
2. Provide:
   - **dataset_name**: Your dataset name.
   - **version**: The version number from the training step.
   - **environment**: Set this to `production` (or `staging` if you prefer an intermediate step).
3. Click **Execute**.
4. Verify that the response (modeled by `PromoteResponse`) confirms the promotion with the new model name, dataset, version, environment, and promotion timestamp.

---

### 4. Predict Using the Model

1. In Swagger, navigate to the `POST /predict` endpoint.
2. Provide the necessary parameters:
   - **dataset_name**: (e.g., `my_dataset`)
   - **environment**: (e.g., `production`)
   - **version**: (if applicable)
   - **features**: A list of dictionaries containing the input features. See the example in the Swagger UI.
3. Click **Execute**.
4. Verify that the response (modeled by `PredictResponse`) returns the expected list of predictions.
